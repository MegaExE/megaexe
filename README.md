### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome!

This is my personal Github Page which I use when I want to code/script, learn or do stuff.

I know some basic program languages:
- Python
- Bash
- Html
- Java Script
- C/C++
- Java

Sometime I will try out and randomly make apps by using android studio and also randomly write codes/try out using different languages to see how it works by using Visual Studio Code.
